- There is 2 item_type of action during a Battle:
Â·         Attack skills to use
Â·         Spells to throw, which consume MP
Â· Actions during Battle are in a 4 slots action bar for attacks and spells each,
    so you have to equip those to use them.
    All of those actions are stored in a Book,
    and you can add or remove them from your actions bar when you are not battling.

- Your character can do only do one attack skill per turn, but you can use unlimited amount of spells during your turn
- Monsters have those two item_type of actions and conditions
